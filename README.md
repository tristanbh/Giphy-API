# GIPHY API

This application was created as part of my Full-Stack Coding Bootcamp curriculum.

This application uses the GIPHY API to make a dynamic page that populates gifs of the users choice. It makes use of the GIPHY API to load the images as well as Javascript and jQuery. 

A working demo can be seen at:
