# GIPHY API

This application was created as part of my Full-Stack Coding Bootcamp curriculum.

This application uses the GIPHY API to make a dynamic page that populates gifs of the users choice. It makes use of the GIPHY API to load the images as well as Javascript and jQuery. 

In the application there are pre-populated buttons the user can click to display a series of animated gifs loaded from the Giphy API. A user can also add a button to the site. To start and stop the animations the user can click on the images. 

A working demo can be seen at:
